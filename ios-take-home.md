# Tech Test

You have been provided with an in-development iOS app. The application uses an open API to display lists of data about the show "Game of Thrones". The project has some bugs and notable UI mismatches with the given designs. Please refrain from using third party packages as this test is to show your best work and how you solve this problem.

## Some issues that have been reported:

- App crashes on launch
- Book data does not display
- Overlapping text in the cells

There are also some undocumented issues that have been discovered.

## Improve the app

In addition to this work a further feature needs to be added that would allow a user to search the lists by name.

## Resources

Designs are available from: [https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5cac66714c1f3aa0dbe192bd](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5cac66714c1f3aa0dbe192bd)

The APIs are available from:
Books - [https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/books](https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/books)
Houses - [https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses](https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses)
Characters = [https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters](https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters)

## Considerations we will be looking for in your submission are:

- Project approach
- Accuracy of designs
- Code quality (e.g patterns and organisation of the application code)
- Error handling
- Unit tests

We would like you to fix the app's user facing issues (both documented and undocumented), add the additional feature work and submit it back in a state suitable for further iterations.

## Submission

Please use version control (ideally git) as you complete this task, and try to remember to commit your code regularly. Once complete either share this through github/bitbucket etc or zip it up and send back

Don't worry if you can't complete everything on the list, try your best and feel free to detail what extra things you would have done if time permitted it.
